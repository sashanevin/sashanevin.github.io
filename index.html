  <div><p>My name is Sasha Nevin. I am currently an undergraduate student at Eastern Washington University, studying Visual Communication Design with a Business Administration minor. Surprisingly enough, I did not attend EWU for the Visual Communication Design program. I initially was interested in the Exercise Science Program, and after getting a job at the gym I noticed their outdated posters, signs, and other design materials. Because of this I took a design drawing class, which sparked my interest even more for design. This is when I decided to entirely change my major from Exercise Science to VCD, and I have been happily designing ever since!</p>

  <p>Because of my well rounded level of expertise in the design world, I have learned a lot and want to eventually work in house. I would like to work for a particular company who specializes in advertising with benefits and the consistency of the same logo, slogan, mission, and people. Also, possibly help rebrand the company, depending on the dated or modern logo associated with the company. Also, I am interested in the little amount of Web Design experience that I have had in this class, and look forward to looking into Web Design more.</p></div>
